## 1. Scope of This Document

Part 1 (`JURISDICTION_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`) covers:
- Architecture, data model, hierarchy, infrastructure
- Data pipeline, storage strategy (Parquet, DuckDB-WASM, IndexedDB)
- High-level UI/UX (scope selector, cascading views)
- Phased implementation roadmap

**This document (Part 2) covers what Part 1 was missing:**
- **Exactly how each tab under Explore behaves** at county, region, and state levels
- **Which tabs are excluded** from jurisdiction expansion entirely
- **Detailed Map tab** rendering strategy (progressive detail, layer controls, drill-down)
- **School & Transit data** expansion strategy (how to load, aggregate, display)
- **Mapillary & Road Inventory** scope restrictions (county/city/municipal only)
- **Why Solutions, Grants, and Reports do NOT expand** (rationale and UI behavior)

---

## 2. Critical Scoping Decision: Explore-Only Expansion

### The Rule

**Only the EXPLORE section participates in multi-jurisdiction expansion.**

The Solutions, Grants, and Reports sections **remain single-jurisdiction / single-location tools** regardless of what scope level the user has selected.

### Rationale

| Section | Why It Does NOT Expand | What It Needs Instead |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Solutions → Countermeasures** | CMF analysis is inherently **per-intersection**. You select one location, one crash pattern, and find matching countermeasures. Aggregating countermeasures across a region is meaningless — each location has different crash patterns requiring different treatments. | When user is at region/state scope, prompt them to select a specific county + location first. |
| **Solutions → Warrant Analyzer** | Signal/stop warrant analysis (MUTCD) requires **specific traffic volumes, crash counts, and geometry** at one intersection. A region-wide warrant analysis doesn't exist in engineering practice. | Same — require location-level selection. |
| **Solutions → MUTCD AI** | MUTCD guidance is applied to **specific situations** (one intersection, one sign placement, one road segment). Regional MUTCD doesn't make sense. | Works at any level since it's knowledge-based Q&A, but answers are per-situation. |
| **Solutions → Domain Knowledge** | Reference material — not data-dependent. | No change needed; already scope-independent. |
| **Grants** | HSIP grant applications are submitted by **a specific county or agency**. A region doesn't apply for HSIP funds — individual counties within that region do. The ranking/scoring is per-county. | When user is at region/state scope, require county selection before entering Grants tab. |
| **Reports** | Reports are generated for **a specific jurisdiction** with that jurisdiction's header, data, and branding. A "Region 1 Report" is a different concept than a "Douglas County Report." | When user is at region/state scope, either (a) require county selection, or (b) offer "Region Summary Report" as a separate report type in a future enhancement. |

### What Part 1 Got Wrong

Part 1, Section 10 (line 1044-1051) shows a table where **CMF, AI Assistant, and Grants** all adapt to region/state scope:

> | CMF | Select intersection in county | Select intersection across any county in region | Select intersection anywhere in state |
> | Grants | County HSIP ranking | Regional HSIP project prioritization | Statewide HSIP allocation by region |

**This should be corrected.** CMF and Grants do NOT expand. The cross-county intersection selection behavior described for CMF at region level is actually part of the **Hot Spots** or **Intersections** tab under Explore, not the CMF/Solutions tab. See [Section 25: Amendments to Part 1](#25-amendments-to-part-1) for the corrections.

### AI Assistant Exception

The AI Assistant (which lives as a panel/overlay, not a dedicated section tab) **does** adapt to context. It should be aware of whatever scope the user is viewing:
- County scope → AI uses county-level crash profile
- Region scope → AI uses region-level aggregated data
- State scope → AI uses statewide summary

This is not a "section expansion" — it's context awareness, which is already designed in Part 1's `getAIAnalysisContext()` pattern.

## 4. Map Tab — Multi-Jurisdiction Display Plan

### The Core Problem

The Map tab currently renders **individual crash markers** (or clusters/heatmaps) for a single county (~5K-50K crashes). At regional level (10 counties, ~50K-200K crashes) or state level (64 counties, ~140K+ crashes), individual markers are:
- **Too numerous** to render performantly
- **Too dense** to provide useful visual information
- **Too expensive** on memory (each marker is a DOM element or canvas draw)

### Solution: Progressive Detail Rendering

The Map tab uses a **different visualization mode at each jurisdiction level**, chosen automatically based on scope:

### Map Drill-Down Interaction Model

```
User opens Map at STATE level
  → Sees Colorado choropleth (counties colored by EPDO)
  → Clicks on Douglas County polygon
    → Map zooms to Douglas County bounds
    → Scope selector changes to "County: Douglas"
    → Map switches to individual crash markers
    → Breadcrumb: "Colorado > Region 1 > Douglas County"
  → User clicks "Back to Region 1"
    → Map zooms out to Region 1 bounds
    → Scope selector changes to "CDOT Region: Region 1"
    → Map switches to choropleth + hotspot markers
```

### Map Boundary GeoJSON Loading Strategy

Loading all boundary geometries upfront would be wasteful. Strategy:

| Level | What to Pre-Load | When to Load |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| State view | State outline + all 64 county boundaries (simplified) + 5 region boundaries | On state view selection |
| Region view | Region boundary + constituent county boundaries (full detail) | On region selection |
| County view | County boundary (full detail) | Already loaded from region/state parent |
| City view | City/Place boundary (from Census Places) | On city selection (lazy fetch) |
| Corridor view | Corridor route geometry (from OpenStreetMap or CDOT) | On corridor selection |

**GeoJSON Size Management:**
- Simplify county boundaries for state-level view using `turf.simplify()` with tolerance ~0.005
- Full-detail boundaries only loaded when user is at that level
- Total estimated GeoJSON size for Colorado: ~2-3 MB (simplified), ~15-20 MB (full detail)
- Cache in IndexedDB after first load

### Choropleth Color Scales

For state and region views, counties are colored using a **sequential or diverging color scale**:

| Metric | Color Scale | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Total Crashes | Sequential blue (light → dark) | Light blue = low crashes, dark blue = high |
| EPDO Score | Sequential red-orange | Light orange = low, dark red = high |
| KA Crash Count | Sequential red | Light red = few KA, dark red = many |
| Crash Rate (per VMT or per capita) | Sequential green-red | Green = safe, red = dangerous |
| Year-over-Year Trend | Diverging green-red | Green = improving, gray = flat, red = worsening |

### Map Technical Implementation Notes

- **Leaflet Choropleth:** Use `L.geoJSON` with `style` function that reads summary stats and returns fill color
- **Leaflet Hover:** `onEachFeature` with `mouseover` / `mouseout` handlers for tooltip + highlight
- **Leaflet Click Drill-Down:** `click` handler changes scope selector and triggers re-render
- **Heatmap at Region Level:** Use existing Leaflet.heat plugin but with **pre-aggregated centroids** (not individual crash points) for performance — each hotspot location becomes one weighted point
- **Memory:** At state level, ZERO crash point data is loaded. Only JSON summaries + GeoJSON boundaries. This is critical for performance.

```

**Key Design Decision:** Hotspots from different counties are ranked **together** using the same EPDO scoring. This allows a Region engineer to see which intersection in the entire region is worst, regardless of which county it's in.

### State Level — Statewide Hot Spots

- Top 50 statewide hotspot locations
- Grouped by region (default) or ungrouped (flat ranking)
- Useful for CDOT HQ systemic safety analysis
- Filter by crash type, severity, route type

---

## 10. Intersections Tab — View Specifications

### County Level

No changes. Intersection-specific analysis within one county.

### Region Level — Cross-County Intersection Ranking

- All intersections across the region ranked by crash frequency/EPDO
- County column for attribution
- Click intersection → drill down to county-level intersection detail
- **Does NOT require loading all raw CSVs** — uses pre-aggregated hotspot data per county

### State Level — Summary Only

At state level, showing individual intersections is impractical (tens of thousands). Instead:
- Summary statistics: "Total signalized intersections with 5+ crashes: 1,245 statewide"
- Per-region intersection safety summary
- "View region detail" links to drill down

---

## 11. Ped/Bike Tab — View Specifications

### County Level

No changes. Pedestrian and bicycle crash analysis for one county.

### Region Level

- Combined ped/bike crashes across all counties
- Per-county comparison: "Pedestrian crashes per capita: Denver 4.2, Boulder 3.1, Douglas 1.8..."
- Regional pedestrian/bicycle crash density heatmap (if map component is shared)
- Countermeasure recommendations based on aggregate regional patterns

### State Level

- Statewide pedestrian/bicycle safety dashboard
- Per-region comparison
- Alignment with state ped/bike safety action plan
- Urban vs. rural ped/bike crash comparison

---

## 12. Analysis Tab — Infrastructure Assets Sub-Tab

### County/City Level

Full functionality — no changes:
- Upload CSV/Excel of infrastructure assets
- Connect to ArcGIS Feature Service
- School Safety sub-tab
- Transit Safety sub-tab

### Region Level — Limited Functionality

At region level, the Infrastructure Assets sub-tab shows **limited** capabilities:
- **Upload File:** Disabled (assets are location-specific)
- **ArcGIS Service:** Available (user can query regional ArcGIS services)
- **School Safety:** Available with aggregated data (see Section 13)
- **Transit Safety:** Available with aggregated data (see Section 14)

### State Level — Disabled

At state level, the Infrastructure Assets sub-tab is **disabled** with message:

> "Infrastructure asset analysis is available at county and region levels. Please select a specific county or region to use this feature."

**Rationale:** Infrastructure asset analysis requires proximity analysis (crashes near assets). At state level with 140K+ crashes and potentially millions of infrastructure points, this becomes computationally intractable in the browser and provides no actionable insights.

---

## 13. Analysis Tab — School Safety Strategy

### The Challenge

School Safety currently loads school locations using a single `education.leaId` from the county config. This fetches schools from one school district. At regional/state level, multiple school districts must be combined.

### County Level — No Changes

- Load schools using `education.leaId` from county config in `config.json`
- Existing school safety analysis (crash proximity, school day vs. off-hours, etc.)
- County config already has `leaId` and `districtName`

### Region Level — Aggregated School Data

**Data Loading Strategy:**

1. Each county in `hierarchy.json` already has (or will have) its `education.leaId` in `config.json`
2. When user selects Region view and navigates to School Safety:
   - Load school lists for ALL constituent counties' LEA IDs
   - Combine into single school dataset with county attribution
   - Perform proximity analysis using region's combined crash data

```

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Performance Consideration:**
- Schools are lightweight (name, lat, lon, type) — loading 800 schools across 10 counties is trivial
- Crash proximity analysis for 800 schools × 85K crashes is computationally expensive
- Solution: Pre-compute school proximity crash counts during the monthly data pipeline
  - `data/CDOT/counties/{fips}/school_crashes.json` → pre-computed crash counts per school
  - Region view loads these lightweight JSONs instead of re-computing proximity

### State Level — Disabled

School safety analysis at state level is **disabled**. Rationale:
- 2,000+ schools × 140K+ crashes = intractable browser computation
- No school district administrator operates at the state level
- CDOT HQ interested in school zone safety would use the region view or run a targeted analysis

### Config Requirement

Each county entry in `config.json` must have `education.leaId` populated. For Colorado's 64 counties, this means mapping all Colorado school districts to their respective counties. Some counties share a school district; some counties have multiple districts.

```json
{
  "douglas": {
    "education": {
      "leaId": "0805580",
      "districtName": "Douglas County School District RE-1"
    }
  },
  "denver": {
    "education": {
      "leaIds": ["0803360"],
      "districtName": "Denver Public Schools"
    }
  },
  "arapahoe": {
    "education": {
      "leaIds": ["0804560", "0800870", "0805160"],
      "districtNames": ["Cherry Creek SD 5", "Littleton SD 6", "Englewood SD 1"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Some counties have multiple school districts. The config should support arrays of LEA IDs for these cases.

---

## 14. Analysis Tab — Transit Safety Strategy

### The Challenge

Transit Safety currently loads transit stops from the National BTS (Bureau of Transportation Statistics) database, filtered by geography. At regional/state level, the number of transit stops increases significantly, especially in urban areas like Denver metro.

### County Level — No Changes

- Load transit stops from BTS API filtered by county bbox
- Existing transit safety analysis (crashes near stops, peak hours, etc.)

### Region Level — Bounded Loading

**Data Loading Strategy:**

1. Use the region's bounding box to query BTS transit stops
2. Load transit stops for ALL counties in the region in one API call
3. Perform proximity analysis with combined regional crash data

**Performance Constraint:**
- Region 1 (Denver metro) may have 5,000-10,000 transit stops (RTD is a major system)
- Loading this many stops is feasible but proximity analysis needs optimization
- Recommendation: Use spatial indexing (e.g., geohash grid) to speed up proximity matching
- Alternative: Pre-compute transit stop crash counts in monthly pipeline

```
Region 1 Transit Safety:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ REGION 1 TRANSIT SAFETY ANALYSIS                            │

│  Most dangerous corridor: E Colfax Ave (RTD Route 15)       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### State Level — Disabled

Transit safety analysis at state level is **disabled**. Rationale:
- Rural counties have few or no transit stops — analysis is meaningless for 40+ of 64 counties
- Urban transit safety is better analyzed at county/region level where transit systems operate
- Loading all transit stops statewide is a large API request for minimal analytical value

---

## 15. Analysis Tab — Mapillary Assets (County/City Only)

### Scope Restriction: County and City/Municipal Level ONLY

Mapillary Assets are **disabled at all levels above county** (region, MPO/TPR, state, corridor).

### Rationale

1. **Tile volume explosion:** Mapillary works by downloading tiles of street-level imagery for traffic sign detection. A county-level area might have 500-2,000 tiles. A region (10 counties) would have 5,000-20,000 tiles. A state would have 50,000+ tiles. This is impractical.

2. **Use case mismatch:** Mapillary asset detection serves **local traffic engineers** who need to inventory signs, signals, and infrastructure in their jurisdiction. A regional planner doesn't need to know where every stop sign is in 10 counties.

3. **API rate limits:** Mapillary API has rate limits that would be exceeded by large-area queries.

4. **Data size:** Downloaded Mapillary asset data for one county is already ~50-200 MB. Multiplying by 10-64x is impractical for browser storage.

### UI Behavior at Region/State/Corridor Level

When user is at any scope above county and clicks the "Mapillary Assets" sub-tab:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

The quick-select buttons show the counties within the current region/MPO for easy drill-down.

---

## 16. Analysis Tab — Road Inventory (County/City Only)

### Scope Restriction: County and City/Municipal Level ONLY

Road Inventory is **disabled at all levels above county** (region, MPO/TPR, state, corridor).

### Rationale

1. **OSM data volume:** Extracting road network data from OpenStreetMap for a single county produces a manageable dataset (~1,000-10,000 road segments). A state would have 200,000+ segments — too large for in-browser processing and rendering.

2. **Processing time:** Road Inventory includes data enrichment (functional class estimation, missing value imputation, quality scoring). This is CPU-intensive and scales linearly with segment count.

3. **Use case mismatch:** Road inventory data serves **county/city engineers** who need to understand their road network attributes (lanes, speed limits, surface type). Regional planners use the state DOT's official road inventory (e.g., CDOT's OTIS system), not OSM extraction.

4. **Map rendering:** Rendering 200K road segments on a Leaflet map would be extremely slow and visually unusable.

### UI Behavior at Region/State/Corridor Level

Same pattern as Mapillary — show disabled message with county quick-select buttons:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ROAD INVENTORY                                              │
│                                                              │
│  ⚠️  Road inventory extraction is available at              │
│     county and city levels only.                             │
│                                                              │
│     OpenStreetMap road network extraction and analysis       │
│     require a focused geographic area. For regional/state    │
│     road inventory data, use CDOT's OTIS system:             │
│     https://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/otis                   │
│                                                              │
│     [Select a County ▼]  to use Road Inventory               │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Bonus recommendation:** At region/state level, provide a link to the state DOT's official road inventory system (CDOT OTIS, VDOT RNS, etc.) as a helpful redirect.

## 17. Solutions Section — No Expansion (Single-Location Only)

### Countermeasures Tab

**Remains single-location.** User must select a specific intersection to analyze crash patterns and find matching CMFs.

When user navigates to Countermeasures while at region/state scope:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ COUNTERMEASURES / CMF ANALYSIS                              │

│  Option 2: [Select a County ▼] then choose a location       │
│                                                              │
│  Option 3: [Search by route/intersection name...]           │
│            (Searches across all Region 1 counties)           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key UX pattern:** Don't make the user go back to change scope. Instead, provide inline location selection that narrows to a county automatically.

### Warrant Analyzer Tab

Same pattern as Countermeasures. Requires specific intersection.

### MUTCD AI Tab

Works at any level — it's knowledge-based Q&A, not data-dependent. No changes needed.

### Domain Knowledge Tab

Works at any level — it's reference material. No changes needed.

## 18. Grants Section — No Expansion (Single-Jurisdiction Only)

### Why Grants Stay Per-County

HSIP (Highway Safety Improvement Program) applications are submitted by **individual counties or agencies**, not by regions or the state. The grant ranking/scoring system evaluates locations within one jurisdiction. A "regional grant view" doesn't exist in practice.

### Future Enhancement (Not in Current Scope)

A potential future enhancement could show "Regional HSIP Portfolio" — which counties in a region have submitted HSIP applications and how the region's safety funding is allocated. This would be a separate feature, not part of the jurisdiction expansion scope.

## 19. Reports Section — No Expansion (Single-Jurisdiction Only)

### Why Reports Stay Per-County

Reports are generated with jurisdiction-specific headers, branding, and data. A "Douglas County Crash Report" is a fundamentally different document from a "Region 1 Crash Report."

### Future Enhancement (Not in Current Scope)

A "Region Summary Report" or "Statewide Safety Performance Report" could be added later as a separate report type. This would use pre-aggregated JSON data and produce a different report format than county-level reports.

## 21. Boundary & GeoJSON Loading Strategy

### File Organization

```
data/CDOT/boundaries/
├── state_outline.geojson           # ~50 KB — Colorado state boundary
├── counties_simplified.geojson     # ~500 KB — All 64 counties (simplified for state view)
├── counties_full/                  # Full-detail county boundaries (loaded on demand)
│   ├── 001_adams.geojson           # ~30 KB each
│   ├── 005_arapahoe.geojson
│   ├── 035_douglas.geojson
│   └── .../
├── regions.geojson                 # ~100 KB — 5 CDOT region boundaries
├── tprs.geojson                    # ~200 KB — 15 TPR/MPO boundaries
└── corridors/                      # Major route geometries
    ├── I-25.geojson
    ├── I-70.geojson
    └── .../
```

### Loading Sequence

| User Action | GeoJSON Loaded | Total Size |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Opens state view | `state_outline` + `counties_simplified` + `regions` | ~650 KB |
| Selects Region 1 | `counties_full/` for 10 counties in Region 1 | ~300 KB additional |
| Drills into Douglas County | Already loaded from Region step | 0 additional |
| Selects corridor I-25 | `corridors/I-25.geojson` | ~50 KB additional |
| Selects TPR view | `tprs.geojson` (if not already loaded) | ~200 KB |

### Live API Alternative: BTS NTAD MPO Boundary Service

Instead of maintaining static `tprs.geojson` files per state, MPO/TPR boundaries can be loaded dynamically from the BTS National Transportation Atlas Database:

**API Endpoint:**
```
https://services.arcgis.com/xOi1kZaI0eWDREZv/arcgis/rest/services/NTAD_Metropolitan_Planning_Organizations/FeatureServer/0/query
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Scope** | National — all US MPOs |
| **Geometry** | `esriGeometryPolygon` — official MPO boundary polygons |
| **Key Fields** | `MPO_ID`, `MPO_NAME`, `ACRONYM`, `STATE`, `POP`, `DESIGNATION_DATE` |
| **Update Frequency** | Quarterly (BTS NTAD schedule) |
| **Cost** | Free, no authentication |

**Loading Strategy for MPO Boundaries:**

| User Action | Data Source | Fallback |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Opens state view | Static `regions.geojson` (CDOT regions) | Always available |
| Selects TPR/MPO view | **BTS MPO API** → query `?where=STATE='CO'&f=geojson` | Static `tprs.geojson` |
| Selects specific MPO (e.g., DRCOG) | **BTS MPO API** → query `?where=ACRONYM='DRCOG'&f=geojson` | Cached from previous query |
| Onboards new state | **BTS MPO API** → auto-discover all MPOs for that state | Manual GeoJSON creation |

**Advantages Over Static GeoJSON:**
- No manual boundary maintenance when MPOs change (expansions, mergers, redesignations)
- Automatically works for any US state during jurisdiction onboarding
- Includes metadata (population, designation date, website) alongside geometry
- Solves the partial-county problem with precise polygon boundaries (see Part 1, Section 13)

### Caching Strategy

- All GeoJSON files cached in IndexedDB after first load
- **BTS MPO boundaries:** Cache in IndexedDB with quarterly expiration (aligned with NTAD updates)
- Cache invalidation: check ETag monthly (boundaries rarely change)
- Simplified boundaries for state view are ALWAYS loaded (fast)
- Full-detail boundaries loaded on demand and cached

## 22. Progressive Detail Rendering Philosophy

### The Core Principle

**The higher the jurisdiction level, the more abstract the visualization.**

```
STATE LEVEL:
  → Polygons (choropleth), no individual data points
  → Pre-computed aggregates only (JSON)
  → Zero raw CSV data in memory
  → Everything renders in <1 second

REGION LEVEL:
  → Polygons + limited data points (Top N hotspots)
  → Mix of pre-computed JSON + on-demand loading
  → Optional heatmap from aggregated centroids
  → Renders in 1-3 seconds

COUNTY LEVEL:
  → Individual data points (markers, clusters, heatmap)
  → Full raw CSV in memory
  → All existing functionality preserved
  → Current rendering performance (unchanged)

CITY LEVEL:
  → Filtered subset of county data
  → Faster than county (fewer points)
```

### Why This Matters for Performance

| Level | Crashes in Scope | Rendering Approach | Memory Usage |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| State (64 counties) | ~142,000 | Choropleth from 64 summary values | ~200 KB (JSON) |
| Region (10 counties) | ~85,000 | Choropleth from 10 summaries + 20 hotspot markers | ~300 KB (JSON) |
| County (1 county) | ~8,000-25,000 | Individual markers / clusters / heatmap | ~15-50 MB (CSV) |
| City (within county) | ~2,000-8,000 | Filtered markers | Same as county (subset) |

The **100x+ memory difference** between state and county views is why progressive detail is essential. Loading 64 county CSVs simultaneously would require 1-3 GB of browser memory — unacceptable.

## 23. Scope Selector Interaction with Non-Explore Tabs

### Problem

When user is at Region/State scope and clicks on a Solutions/Grants/Reports tab (which requires county-level selection), what happens?

### Solution: Inline Scope Narrowing

The Solutions/Grants/Reports tabs do NOT change the scope selector. Instead, they show an inline "select county" prompt that:

1. Lists counties available in the current scope (e.g., the 10 counties in Region 1)
2. Provides a search box for quick finding
3. Once user selects a county, the tab loads with that county's data
4. The main scope selector remains at the region/state level
5. A breadcrumb shows: "Region 1 > Douglas County > Countermeasures"
6. A "Back to Region" link returns to the Explore section at the region level

### State Persistence

- If user selects "Douglas County" in Countermeasures, then switches to Warrants, Douglas County should still be pre-selected
- This is stored in a temporary `solutionsScopeCounty` state variable
- It resets if the user changes the main scope selector

```
┌── Scope Selector ────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  State: [Colorado ▼]   View: [CDOT Region ▼] [Region 1]  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

When in Solutions tab:
┌── Tab Content ───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  COUNTERMEASURES                                          │
│  ┌─ County Context ─────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │  Analyzing: Douglas County (within Region 1)      │    │
│  │  [Change County ▼]                                │    │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                                           │
│  [Normal countermeasures interface for Douglas County]     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 24. Performance Constraints by Jurisdiction Level

### Memory Budget

| Level | Max CSV in Memory | JSON Summaries | GeoJSON | Total Target |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| County | 1 CSV (~15-50 MB) | 1 county summary (~5 KB) | County boundary (~30 KB) | ~50 MB max |
| Region | 0-3 CSVs (on demand) | Region + N county summaries (~50 KB) | Region + county boundaries (~400 KB) | ~150 MB max |
| State | 0 CSVs | State + 5 region + 64 county summaries (~400 KB) | State + simplified counties (~650 KB) | ~5 MB max |

### Key Constraint: State View Must Be Instant

At state level, the dashboard and map must render **immediately** from pre-computed JSON. Zero raw CSV processing. If a user selects "Statewide" and has to wait 30 seconds for 64 CSVs to load, the tool is unusable.

This is why the monthly data pipeline must produce:
- `statewide.json` (~20 KB)
- `regions/region_N.json` (~10 KB each, 50 KB total)
- `counties/{fips}/summary.json` (~5 KB each, 320 KB total)

Total: **~390 KB** for full statewide dashboard rendering. Instant on any connection.

## 25. Amendments to Part 1

The following corrections should be applied to `JURISDICTION_EXPANSION_PLAN.md` (Part 1):

### Amendment 1: Section 10, Adaptive Behavior Table (Line 1044-1051)

**Remove** the CMF and Grants rows from the multi-jurisdiction adaptation table. Replace with:

| Feature | County View | Region View | State View |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Dashboard | Single county stats | Region aggregate + per-county breakdown | Statewide + per-region breakdown |
| Map | County boundary, all crashes | Choropleth + heatmap + Top-N markers | Choropleth (counties colored by metric) |
| Hotspots | Top locations in county | **Cross-county ranking** across region | **Statewide Top 50**, grouped by region |
| Crash Tree | County tree | Aggregate tree with county attribution | State tree with region attribution |
| Safety Focus | County categories | Region aggregate with county comparison | State emphasis areas by region |
| Intersections | County intersections | Cross-county intersection ranking | Summary only |
| Ped/Bike | County ped/bike | Region aggregate + county comparison | State aggregate + region comparison |
| AI Assistant | County context | Region context | Statewide context |
| **CMF** | **County only** | **Requires county selection** | **Requires county selection** |
| **Grants** | **County only** | **Requires county selection** | **Requires county selection** |
| **Analysis** | **Full** | **Limited (no Mapillary/Road Inv)** | **Disabled** |

### Amendment 2: Section 12, Regional Map (Line 1292-1296)

**Enhance** with progressive detail rendering strategy and layer control specifications from Section 4 of this document.

### Amendment 3: Add Note to Section 6 (Hierarchical Jurisdiction Model)

Add a note after line 335:

> **SCOPE LIMITATION:** The jurisdiction hierarchy applies to the EXPLORE section only. Solutions, Grants, and Reports tabs always operate at county level. When the user is at a higher scope and navigates to these tabs, they are prompted to select a specific county within the current scope. See Part 2, Section 2 for detailed rationale.

### Amendment 4: Phase 3 Task Additions (Line 2016-2032)

Add these tasks to Phase 3:

| # | Task | Effort | Dependencies |
|---|------|--------|--------------|
| 3.10 | Implement tab-level scope restrictions (disable Mapillary/Road Inventory at region+) | 2 days | 2.5 |
| 3.11 | Implement inline county selector for Solutions/Grants/Reports at higher scopes | 3 days | 2.5 |
| 3.12 | Build progressive detail rendering for Map tab (choropleth at state, hybrid at region) | 5 days | 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 |
| 3.13 | Pre-compute school proximity crash counts in data pipeline | 2 days | 2.4 |

---

## Summary

This document resolves the five gaps identified in Part 1:

1. **Map Tab Display** — Fully specified with progressive detail rendering (choropleth → hybrid → markers), layer controls per level, drill-down interaction model, boundary loading strategy, and choropleth color scales.

2. **School & Transit Data** — County level unchanged. Region level aggregates multiple LEA IDs / BTS bounding boxes. State level disabled. Pre-computed proximity data recommended for performance.

3. **Mapillary & Road Inventory** — Explicitly restricted to county/city/municipal level. Disabled with helpful messages and county quick-select buttons at higher levels. Clear rationale documented (tile volume, API limits, use case mismatch).

4. **Explore-Only Expansion** — Solutions, Grants, and Reports are definitively excluded from jurisdiction expansion. Inline county selection provided when users navigate to these tabs at higher scopes. Part 1 amendments specified.

5. **Per-Tab View Specifications** — Complete view adaptation matrix covering all 13+ tabs × 6 jurisdiction levels with specific data source, visualization type, controls, and performance characteristics.
